Arduino programs, Java Serial Reader and other test programs

The arduino programs was used under development of the initial Mjolnir algorithms for magnetic field detection
Further more It was used for Wind tunnel test of mjolnir.
Lastly the programs was used in the initial Development of Sleipnir.

Unless we need to do some new Raw magnetic field measurement these libraries / programs are not needed.
